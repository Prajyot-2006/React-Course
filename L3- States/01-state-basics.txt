State = data that is connected to the HTML
when we update this data, it will update the HTML
or 
State = automatically updtaes the HTML when data changes

🧠 What is useState?
useState is a function in React that lets you create and manage state (data that can change) inside a function component.

state has 2 values first is the current(initial value) and 2nd is the function which is used to update that value
/*
// Note : React.useState returns an array , so lets us store that array in a variable
      const array = React.useState([  // so this will convert this data into state , when we update this data it will also updat the HTML
        {
        message: 'hello chatbot',
        sender: 'user',
        id: 'id1'
        },
        {
          message: 'Hello! How can I help you?',
          sender: 'robot',
          id: 'id2'
        },
        {
          message: 'Can you get me Todays date?',
          sender: 'user',
          id: 'id3'
        },
        {
          message: 'Today is July 25',
          sender: 'robot',
          id: 'id4'
        }
      ])
      const chatMessages = array[0]; // the first value in this array gives us the The current value of chatMessages(The current data)
      const setChatMessages = array[1];

just explain me this in very detail but in simple

🧠 Basic idea:
React.useState(...) is used to make a variable reactive — meaning, if you change it, the UI will also change

✅ This code:
const array = React.useState([
  { message: 'hello chatbot', sender: 'user', id: 'id1' },
  { message: 'Hello! How can I help you?', sender: 'robot', id: 'id2' },
  { message: 'Can you get me Todays date?', sender: 'user', id: 'id3' },
  { message: 'Today is July 25', sender: 'robot', id: 'id4' }
]);

What it does:
It creates a state variable using React.useState(...)
It gives the initial data — which is an array of chat messages (each message is an object with message text, sender, and id).
This useState returns an array with 2 things:
The current data (in this case, all chat messages)
A function to update that data
We store that whole returned array in a variable named array.

👇 Next line:
const chatMessages = array[0];
This takes the first thing from the array returned by useState
So chatMessages holds the current data — the array of chat messages
You can use this to show messages on the screen (e.g., in HTML/JSX).

👇 Next line:
const setChatMessages = array[1];
This takes the second thing from the array
It's a function that lets you change the chat messages
Whenever you use this function, React will update the screen automatically

🧾 Summary (in even simpler terms):
useState(...) gives you two things:
➤ Current value
➤ A function to update that value

const chatMessages = array[0]; // “the first value in this array gives us the current value of chatMessages (The current data)”
Ans : Yes — that means:
👉 All the current values inside that array of messages.

So in this code:
const array = React.useState([
  { message: 'hello chatbot', sender: 'user', id: 'id1' },
  { message: 'Hello! How can I help you?', sender: 'robot', id: 'id2' },
  { message: 'Can you get me Todays date?', sender: 'user', id: 'id3' },
  { message: 'Today is July 25', sender: 'robot', id: 'id4' }
]);
const chatMessages = array[0];
==>
✅ chatMessages now holds:
[
  { message: 'hello chatbot', sender: 'user', id: 'id1' },
  { message: 'Hello! How can I help you?', sender: 'robot', id: 'id2' },
  { message: 'Can you get me Todays date?', sender: 'user', id: 'id3' },
  { message: 'Today is July 25', sender: 'robot', id: 'id4' }
]


i though it will only give the first element that is   { message: 'hello chatbot', sender: 'user', id: 'id1' },
bcoz array[0] means the 1st value of an array , yes ?
Chatgpt said :
You're absolutely right about array[0] usually meaning the first element of an array — like:
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // 'apple'

But in this case, the confusion is because of this line:
const array = React.useState([...]);

🔁 What does React.useState(...) return?
It returns a new array like this:
[ currentValue, setFunction ]

So this is not your original data array anymore — it’s a new array with two elements:
The full state value (your whole messages array)
A function to update that state

array[0] is: your entire messages array
array[1] is: the function to change it



So yes — it holds all the objects (all messages) that you gave to useState() initially.
And later if you add or change messages using setChatMessages, the chatMessages variable will also automatically get the updated array next time React re-renders.



// in very short :
useState gives us two values 
1st value is the current data 
2nd value is the updater function (if we update the fn it will also update the html)
