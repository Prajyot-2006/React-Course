        setCount(count + 1);  // this fn replace the count variable with this parameter , why only count variable bcoz useState gives 2 values 1st is the curent value and 2nd is the fn to update that current value , so in this example the 1st value is stored in count variable and the 2nd value which is fn that is stored in a setCount variable so count is tied to setCount bcoz of ReactUseState

<!--
Some doubts :

when we give something to setCount then the setCount fn starts and updates the count variable 
by replacing that something value or setCount's parameter , is that correct ?

Answer :
Exactly right! Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:
setCount is a function React gives you to update the state variable count.
When you call setCount(1), React replaces the current value of count(which is 0) with 1.
After calling setCount(1), React re-renders your component or it re-renders the component's return statemnt so that count becomes 1 inside your component. (btw this is automation feature in react we dont see how it re-renders)
So yes, setCount updates the state value (count) by replacing it with whatever argument you pass.


Important:
Calling setCount does not immediately change count in your current code execution.
It tells React: "Please update count to this new value and re-render later."

Example:
console.log(count);  // say it's 0 now
setCount(1);
console.log(count);  // still 0 here, because state update is async
But on the next render, count will be 1.

Inshort about 2nd value(or the fn) of the useState : When you call the state updater function (setCount), 
React schedules a re-render of the component, and that means it re-runs the function and re-evaluates the JSX inside the return to update the UI.
