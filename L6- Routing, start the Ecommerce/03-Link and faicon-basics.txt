The Link component in React (from react-router-dom) is used to navigate between different pages or routes without reloading the page.

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}


Here:
to="/" → sets the path to navigate to.
Clicking the link changes the URL and shows the correct page, but the app doesn’t refresh like a normal <a> tag.

here's the difference btwn <a> tage and Link component , u will get to know why we use Link instead of <a></a>

| <Link> (React)                                       | <a> (HTML)                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Comes from react-router-dom.                         | Built into HTML.                                  |
| Changes the URL *without refreshing* the whole page. | Reloads the entire page when clicked.             |
| Faster, keeps your app state (no data lost).           | Page reloads, losing app state.                   |
| Use for navigation *inside your React app.          | Use for **external websites* or non-React pages. |


favicon means the small icon which we see in browsers tab or before the title name
