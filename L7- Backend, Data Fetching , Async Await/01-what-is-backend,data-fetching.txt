what is backend : 
backend is a another computer or company's computer which is used for data fet6ching or sending data 
we have downloaded a backend code from supersimple's link in description 

what is data fetching :
data fetching = get data from the backend(using our code)

asynchronous code = a code that does not finish right away

fetch returna promise 
promise = let us wait for asynchronous code to finish


fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/products').then((response) => {

})
this link btwn fetch is get request that means we are requesting data to this link it takes time to send and get a response from it so whenever in future we get a response then the .then fn will run 
thats what is fetch , when fetch gets a response from the backend it will save it as a parameter in this inner fn called response

api/products this is called a request 
the backend give a response is called a response
