we already learned to download and use node js to run js code outside of a web-page or browser 
npm = node package manager
package = external library
npm = lets us install external libraries or packages into our project 


we have done this in this lesson and named the project name as chatbot-project
package = create-vite 
what it does = helps us setup a new react project

to use create-vite command we need to do 2 steps :
1. install the create-vite package
2. run the create-vite in the command line

we have a shortcut for this called npx which does this 2 steps in a single step 
npx create-vite@6.0.1 {which i got from supersimledev's descripton}
@ = we gonna use a specific version of create-vite 
Now run this to install all packages which are needed for this project or to run react code
cd chatbot-project
npm install (its gonna install a lot of packages) all of the packages are downloaded in the node module folder
npm run dev (this wil start up our new react website)
